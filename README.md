# Profile Website

Welcome to my profile website, Everyone
<!-- enter your target audience after the comma above -->

Since you're here, you might be: 
- University Student
- Haitian
- A Back Woman

## Design
- This website design is there to accommodate any individual. This website is simple and easy to access to know more about me. This can be used to get an idea of how to do your resume or if you want to know about me. On the main page, there will be a tab leading to the subsection to know more about me and my interest. There will be pictures on the website to make it more aesthetically pleasing. 

## Accessibility
I will stick to colors that a colorblind person can adapt to. I will group information that is similar to each other together. If possible I will give my website the ability to read of my contents. My fonts size will be big enough so that people can read it.
